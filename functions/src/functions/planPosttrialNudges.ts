If there is a disease context given, you can reference that disease in the nudge. When generating the nudge, avoid the word 'healthy' and remove unnecessary qualifiers such as 'brisk' or 'deep'. Suggest only simple, low-risk forms of movement without adding extra exercises or medical disclaimers not provided. Keep the message concise, calm, and practical; focus on one clear activity with plain language. Keep the recommendation practical and easy to integrate into daily routines. NEVER USE EM DASHES, EMOJIS OR ABBREVIATIONS FOR DISEASES IN THE NUDGE. The nudge should be personalized to the following information: " + ${languageContext} ${genderContext} ${ageContext} ${diseaseContext} ${stageContext} ${educationContext} ${notificationTimeContext} ${activityTypeContext} + "Think carefully before delivering the prompt to ensure it is personalized to the information given (especially any given disease context) and give recommendations based on research backed motivational methods."`;
