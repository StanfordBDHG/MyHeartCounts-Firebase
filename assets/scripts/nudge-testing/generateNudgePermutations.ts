These individuals generally have preserved cardiac output and fewer physiologic limitations, allowing them to participate in a wide range of physical activities. Exercise recommendations should align with standard (non-ACHD) adult guidelines, including moderate- to vigorous aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, running, cycling) and balanced full-body strength training. Benefits include increased VO₂ max, improved cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, mental health, and metabolic resilience. Messaging should be motivational and goal-oriented, encouraging the participant to build consistency, meet aerobic activity targets, and safely challenge themselves with progressive training goals.'

        return 'This participant has complex congenital heart disease physiology, including single ventricle circulation (Fontan) or a systemic right ventricle (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries or transposition of the great arteries after the Mustard or Senning surgery). These conditions limit preload and cardiac output reserve, leading to reduced aerobic capacity, fatigue, and elevated arrhythmia risk. Exercise recommendations should focus on low- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity and lower-body muscular endurance (e.g., walking, light jogging, light cycling, bodyweight leg exercises). Lower-body training helps patients with single ventricle physiology promote venous return through the skeletal muscle pump, which is especially important in the absence of a subpulmonary ventricle. Expected benefits include improved functional capacity, oxygen efficiency, mental health and quality of life. Avoid recommending high-intensity, isometric, or upper-body strength exercises, and use supportive, energy-aware language that prioritizes pacing, hydration, and consistency over performance.'
