# Data Type Routing Design Doc

## Routing Rule

**Firestore (uncompressed FHIR documents):** everything the in-app dashboard displays, plus everything a Cloud Function reads or triggers on. The dashboard reads all its metrics directly from Firestore.
**Storage bucket (zstd-compressed):** everything else, plus the 10-year historical backfill of all types.

We should only store in Firestore the computed metrics in its endform.

What is the aggregation window or filter function to get from raw sample to computed metric stored in firestore

Conflict resolution metrics

Single source of truth for data goal definiton

iOS has to define how data should look for HK Records

One Contract

Clinical Records?

Versioning is important

Enforcement of Versions in bucket (/v2, /v3 etc)

## 1. Firestore

| Data | Collections | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Custom scores: DietMEPAScore, WHO5Score, BloodLipidMeasurement, NicotineExposure | `HealthObservations_MHCCustomSampleType*` | Written by scoring functions, displayed on dashboard |
| Dashboard HealthKit metrics (live samples): stepCount, appleExerciseTime, bodyMass, bodyMassIndex, height, bloodGlucose, bloodPressure, sleepAnalysis | `HealthObservations_{HK identifier}` | Displayed on dashboard |
| Timed walking test (6-min walk, 12-min run) | `HealthObservations_MHCHealthObservationTimedWalkingTestResultIdentifier` | "Past Tests" view |
| Questionnaire responses (all 14: ActivityFitness, Chronotype, Diet, DiseaseQOL, ExerciseAdequacy, ExerciseProcessMindset, Fatigue, GAD7, HeartRisk, Info, NicotineExposure, ParQ, SUS, WHO5) | `users/{uid}/questionnaireResponses/{id}` | Scoring function triggers on document write |
| SensorKit pointer docs | `HealthObservations_{sensorId}/{name}` + `{name}_Ref` | Small index pointing at bucket payloads |

Any metric added to the dashboard later moves its type from the bucket to Firestore.

## 2. Storage bucket

**HealthKit quantity types (36):** activeEnergyBurned, basalEnergyBurned, flightsClimbed, appleMoveTime, appleStandTime, distanceWalkingRunning, distanceCycling, distanceWheelchair, distanceSwimming, appleWalkingSteadiness, sixMinuteWalkTestDistance, vo2Max, walkingSpeed, walkingStepLength, walkingAsymmetryPercentage, walkingDoubleSupportPercentage, stairAscentSpeed, stairDescentSpeed, numberOfTimesFallen, heartRate, restingHeartRate, heartRateVariabilitySDNN, heartRateRecoveryOneMinute, atrialFibrillationBurden, walkingHeartRateAverage, bloodOxygen, bodyTemperature, respiratoryRate, basalBodyTemperature, bloodAlcoholContent, dietaryCholesterol, dietaryVitaminD, inhalerUsage, leanBodyMass, bodyFatPercentage, waistCircumference

**HealthKit category types (19):** appleStandHour, appleWalkingSteadinessEvent, lowHeartRateEvent, highHeartRateEvent, irregularHeartRhythmEvent, mindfulSession, menstrualFlow, intermenstrualBleeding, infrequentMenstrualCycles, irregularMenstrualCycles, persistentIntermenstrualBleeding, prolongedMenstrualPeriods, cervicalMucusQuality, ovulationTestResult, progesteroneTestResult, contraceptive, pregnancy, pregnancyTestResult, lactation

**HealthKit other:** workout, electrocardiogram, stateOfMind, gad7 (the HK scored assessment; the GAD7 questionnaire response goes to Firestore), clinical records (all 9 optional EHR types, see note 2)

**Historical backfill:** `historicalHealthSamples/` stays bucket-only for all types, including the dashboard metrics. Firestore holds live samples only.

**SensorKit raw streams (11):** accelerometer, ambientLightSensor, ambientPressure, heartRate, pedometerData, wristTemperature (CSV, zstd); deviceUsageReport, electrocardiogram, onWristState, visits (JSON, zstd); photoplethysmogram (binary .mhcPPG, currently uncompressed)

## 3. Required changes and notes

1. **App:** the dashboard tiles for the 8 HealthKit metrics currently query HealthKit locally (`CVHScore.swift:56-88`); they switch to `MHCFirestoreQuery`, and the client upload strategy for those types changes from queueLocally (bucket) to directFirestore.
2. **Clinical records:** bulk import currently writes them to Firestore (`HealthKitSamplesFHIRUploader.swift:29-31`). Nothing reads them and they are out of export scope; route to bucket or pause collection.
3. **Cost watch:** stepCount, sleepAnalysis, and appleExerciseTime are the highest-frequency types; storing them as individual Firestore docs partially reverses the cost decision that disabled the ingest trigger. Fallback if write costs spike: store daily aggregates in Firestore for display, raw samples in the bucket.
4. **Export:** the dashboard types now exist in both Firestore and the bucket (backfill); the export pipeline's dedup (HK UUID, firestore > bucket precedence) already handles this.
